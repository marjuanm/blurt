Blurt is a public social blockchain that uses Larimer-style Dpos, meaning that its code is characterized by heavy use of the Boost C++ libraries, and it uses the fc library for many of its core functions.

## Economy

We feel that all actions that impose costs should themselves have a cost, so that we can avoid becoming a garbage patch. We're developing features that keep us out of "tragedy of the commons" type situations.

## Software Development

Work is ongoing in the `dev` branch.

The snapshot-verification code can be found in the `snapshot` branch.

Our next milestone is [Hard Fork 3](https://gitlab.com/blurt/blurt/-/milestones/2)
